## Industries Utilizing Robotics: :robot:

* [Healtchcare sector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM1GZSO7MYs)
    * Surgery robots 
    * Therapy robots (like [Paro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZUn9qtG8ow) for dementia; rehabilitation robots)
    * assistive robots 
    * social robots (e.g. humanoid robots [Pepper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJHyaD1psMc) or [NAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2STTNYNF4lk)) 
* [Manufacturing e.g. Automotive Industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7fi4hP_y80)
    * consist mainly of mechanical arms tasked with pick and place (other examples: robotic welding machine, palletizing robot arm, automatic painting robot,...)
* [Agriculture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd9JZXscOIE)
*  <span style="color: blue;">Military</span>
    * Military robots use artificial intelligence for carrying out different tasks like picking off snipers, target acquisition, climbing ladders, operating in disaster situations, explosive ordnance disposal, search and rescue, fire fighting, and many more.

* Further examples: 
    * Aerospace
    * Beverage
    * Computers
    * Consumer goods
    * E-Commerce
    * Electronics
    * Food
    * Grocery
    * Hardware
    * Liquor distribution
    * Medical products
    * Pharmaceutical
    * Quality control and inspection
    * Retail
    * Warehousing and distribution
    
## Advantages of robots

* In some situations, they can improve productivity, efficiency, quality, and consistency.
* Robots, unlike humans, do not become bored.
* They may continually repeat the same procedure till they wear out.
* Robots can operate in hazardous conditions, such as with harmful chemicals or in places with high radiation.
* They may be exceedingly exact, down to fractions of an inch, which makes them very valuable in the manufacture of microelectronics. Some robots have sensors and actuators that outperform humans.
* They do not have the same physical or environmental demands as humans.


## Disadvantages of robots

* Robots are displacing human workers in various areas, which might cause economic concerns.
* Because of current robotics technology, most machines are less dexterous than humans and cannot compete with humans' capacity to comprehend what they perceive. But researchers are working on producing robots that can better detect their surroundings.
* Overall, robots can only perform what they are taught to do, which means they cannot improvise (although AI and machine learning is changing this).
* Robots with practical applications are typically costly in terms of original cost, maintenance, the requirement for additional components, and the need to be programmed to perform the task.
* Legal  challenges  in  robots  have  been  a  topic  of  debate  for  many  decades.  As mentioned earlier someone  must be held  accountable for any  crime committed by robots.

## Conclusion 

Robots may be one of the greatest inventions ever, but we must utilise their power with prudence. Perhaps it is a good idea to have industrial robots that can reduce human danger, raise production, and increase profit. But it is insane to design or build anything that threatens the very existence of its creator. Although humanoid robots are still primarily confined to science fiction, robotic devices are all around us. These engineering marvels currently assist us in many aspects of life and have the potential to influence our future.

Despite a number of advantages and downsides, one thing is certain: persons with robotics expertise will be in great demand in the future. There will almost certainly always be work in the field of robotics, whether it be designing, programming, or maintaining robots.
